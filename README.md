THESE CFG FILES WILL NEED TO BE PLACED IN THE CFG FOLDER IN TF2 BY GOING TO ***PROGRAM FILES (x86) > STEAM > STEAMAPPS > COMMON > TEAM FORTRESS 2***

THESE FILES INCLUDE A BHOP SCRIPT THAT IS NOT MADE BY ME.

PLEASE NOTE THESE FILES MAY REPLACE ***YOUR*** CFG FILES SO PLEASE BACK UP ANY CFG FILES YOU WOULD LIKE TO KEEP.

I RECOMMEND USING THESE LAUNCH OPTIONS: -nojoy -nosteamcontroller -nohltv -particles 1 -precachefontchars -noquicktime
